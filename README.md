# Getting started to Develop Your Secure Web Applications

All applications must be developed with security in mind so that they do not contain common security vulnerabilities subject to security attacks. An attack may cause stealth of user credential, loss of sensitive information, service disruption, and result in damage to business reputation and revenue.

This starter app helps Bluemix Liberty developers develop your secure Java applications that avoid several common and dangerous security vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Injection, Directory Traversal, and more to come such as Session Hijacking, Cross-Side Request Forgery, SQL Injection. 
			 
The GoodServlet.java includes a number of good coding practices such as input validation, output encoding, secure Http Header settings, Content Security Policy. Using this application as a development starting point and applying the coding practices to the new APIs of your applications you will inherit and extend the necessary defense against those high-risk security vulnerabilities.

Check out the Secure Coding Advicer (https://secure-coding-advisor.stage1.mybluemix.net/) for more XSS lessons, the theory of XSS attacks and defense, and the bad-code vs good-code examples on XSS and other vulnerabilities. The Secure Coding Advisor will be available to the Bluemix Public for all Bluemix developers shortly. 
	
You may download this starter application, build it, and deploy it on Bluemix just the same way as you have learned and done with the get-started-java sample application.

update project profile with a short description and eye-catching graphic.

define some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give interested developers a sense of cadence and upcoming enhancements.
